/**
 * Represents the local topology of tasks for an operator. It
 * provides methods to send/rcv from parents & children
 * <p/>
 * Every operator is an EventHandler<GroupCommunicationMessage>
 * and it will use an instance of this type to delegate the
 * handling of the message and also uses it to communicate
 * with its parents and children
 * <p/>
 * This is an operator facing interface. The actual topology is
 * maintained in OperatorTopologyStruct. Current strategy is to
 * maintain two versions of the topology and current operations
 * are always delegated to effectiveTopology and the baseTopology
 * is updated while initialization & when user calls updateTopology.
 * So this is only a wrapper around the two versions of topologies
 * and manages when to create/update them based on the messages from
 * the driver.
