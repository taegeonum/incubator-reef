// This implementation uses the fork join framework to reduce the cost of spawning
// events in stages. For two participating stages back to back, the pool allows
// for the thread in the first stage to execute the event it submits to the second stage.
// These choices are made by the ForkJoinPool.
// 
// So, this does sort of go against the reason for stages, but doesn't eliminate them
// and raises the level of abstraction that Wake sees above threads.

// That is no event submitted to the pool can have a producer/consumer dependency
// on another event submitted to the pool
