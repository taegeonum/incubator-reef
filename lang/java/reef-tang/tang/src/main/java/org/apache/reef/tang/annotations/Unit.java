/**
 * A TANG Unit consists of an outer class and some non-static inner classes.
 * TANG injectors automatically treat all the classes in a unit as singletons.
 * <p/>
 * In order to inject the singleton instance of each inner class, TANG first
 * instantiates the outer class and then uses the resulting instance to
 * instantiate each inner class.
 * <p/>
 * Classes annotated in this way must have at least one non-static inner class
 * and no static inner classes. The inner classes must not declare any
 * constructors.
 * <p/>
 * Furthermore, classes annotated with Unit may not have injectable (or Unit)
 * subclasses.
