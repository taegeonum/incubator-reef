/**
 * A future-based mechanism for cyclic object injections. Since Tang is a
 * constructor-based dependency injector, there is no way to directly create
 * cycles of objects.
 * <p/>
 * In situations where you need to have two objects that point at each other, you
 * can use an InjectionFuture to break the cycle. Simply ask Tang to inject an
 * InjectionFuture<T> into your constructor.  Later (after your constructor
 * returns) invoke the get() method of the injection future to get a reference
 * to an injected object of type T.
 * <p/>
 * Note that InjectorFutures and singletons interact in subtle ways.
 * <p/>
 * Normally, Tang never reuses a reference to an injected object unless the
 * object is a singleton or a volatile instance. If InjectionFutures followed
 * this convention, then a cyclic injection of two non-singleton classes would
 * result in an an infinite chain of objects of the two types. Tang addresses
 * this issue as follows:
 * <p/>
 * 1) In the first pass, it injects a complete object tree, making note of
 * InjectionFuture objects that will need to be populated later. The injection
 * of this tree respects standard Tang singleton and volatile semantics.
 * <p/>
 * 2) In a second pass, Tang populates each of the InjectionFutures with the
 * reference to the requested class that was instantiated in the first pass. If
 * this reference does not exist (or is non-unique) then an InjectionException
 * is thrown.
 * <p/>
 * Note: The semantics of complex cyclic injections may change over time.
 * <p/>
 * We haven't seen many complicated injections that involve cycles in practice.
 * A second approach would be to establish some scoping rules, so that each
 * InjectionFuture binds to the innermost matching parent in the InjectionPlan.
 * This would allow plans to inject multiple cycles involving distinct objects
 * of the same type.
